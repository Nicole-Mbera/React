      "description": ["Akagera National Park Rwanda is found in North Eastern Rwanda,at the country’s border with Tanzania.It is dominated by swamps and small lakes with flow in the wake of River Kagera. The network of water sources and unique landscape together create very spectacular scenery.It is quite a remarkable eco-system. The Park was obviously named after River Kagera thatfeeds different water bodies including Lake Ihema.Surrounded by cultivated hills,that are so much a part of Rwanda scenery,the scenery of Akagera national Park is quite simply beautiful.The landscape is low, composed of wide plains dominated by grass,cactus-like Euphorbia candelabra shrub and both thick and thin forests although it does carry on with the general ruggedterrain that is so characteristic of Rwanda. Nyungwe is Rwanda's newest and largest national park, extending across 1,000 square kilometres of mountainous southwestern Burundi border region, where it protects the largest extant montane rainforest in East Africa. Nyungwe's main attraction for most visitors is its population of at least 500 chimpanzees, which can be tracked at Cyamudongo, a relict montane forest patch protected as an isolated annex to the park. The other big draw, constructed in 2010, is a 200-metre-long canopy walkway that offers thrilling views of life above the forest floor."],
